# The Game "Square Snake"
Snake is a classic game where the player controls a snake that moves around the game board, eating food and growing in length with each piece of food consumed. The objective is to avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own body while attempting to score as many points as possible.

## How to play
To control the snake in the game, use the up, down, left, and right arrow keys to change the direction of the snake's movement. The objective is to move the snake around the game board, eating candies and growing in length. However, if the snake collides with the walls or its own body, the game ends. The longer the snake grows and the more candies it eats, the higher the score. Keep playing to see how high you can score before the game ends!
